    "In an overly elaborate halloween trick a large fake bat  (mass 2kg) is to be raised using a rope which runs over a pulley and is wound around a wheel which can then be turned with a handle. The wheel has mass 4kg and has a radius of 20cm, while the pulley has a mass of 0.5kg and a radius of 10cm. The handle has a length of 30cm and is attached to the center of the wheel.

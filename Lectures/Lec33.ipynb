In this approximation the stages of the cycle in which heat transfer occurs are isothermal, but in fact this is very much not the case, for a refrigerator to work we actually rely on these stages to convert the refrigerant from liquid to vapor in the evaporator (due to the $Q_{L}$ added to the refrigerant) and from vapor to liquid in the condenser (due to the $Q_{H}$ removed from the refrigerant).

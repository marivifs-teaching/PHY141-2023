The question of stability concerns what happens when equilibrium is **slightly** disturbed. If the equilibrium is stable the system will return to it's equilibrium position, but if it instead moves away from the equilibrium then we say the equilibrium is unstable. If the small perturbation moves the system to a new equilibrium we can say the equilibrium is **neutral**.\n",

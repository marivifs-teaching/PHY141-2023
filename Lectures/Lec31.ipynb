    "Heat is the energy transferred from one body to another due to thermal contact when the bodies are at different temperatures.\n",

    "An early theory of heat was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory\" class=\"interwiki iw_wp\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory\">caloric theory</a>, which suggested that there was a fluid called caloric that was transferred from a hot to a cold body. The idea that there was a particular substance associated with heat would imply conservation of heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key player in overturning the caloric theory was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule\" class=\"interwiki iw_wp\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule\">James Prescott Joule</a>. Through number of experiments, initially motivated by his interest in using electric motors to power his brewery he was able to show the relationship between energy and heat, i.e. heat is the transfer of energy that occurs between two systems at different temperatures.\n"

(Note that the work done is negative, the frictional force reduces the kinetic energy.) If we push it back to it&#039;s original position the force is now in the opposite direction so the work done by the frictional force is again $-F_{Fr}d$. As the total work done is $-2F_{Fr}d$ we can see that friction is not a conservative force.\n"
